# Learning-mode: on
This is the first serious project I worked on.
In this project, I undertook the development and training of five distinct machine learning models utilizing Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and an array of essential libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 
The primary objective of this project was to leverage these models to achieve precise predictions of automobile prices based on a comprehensive set of specific features.
The models subjected to rigorous evaluation encompassed:
Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Pipeline (Combining Polynomial Features with Ridge Regularization)
Ridge Regression (Best Model)
The assessment of these models unveiled a clear frontrunner, the "Pipeline" model. 
This model distinguished itself by achieving the highest R-squared value and the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in comparison to its peers, attesting to its superior predictive performance.
